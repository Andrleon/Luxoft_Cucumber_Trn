Feature: Search for items on Etsy
  As a user
  I want to search for different items
  So that I will be able to buy necessary items fast

  Scenario: Search for particular item
    Given I am on the main page
    When I accept terms and conditions
    # Implement next step
    When I set page language to "English"
    And I search for "leather bag" items
    Then I see search results
    When I select "Belarus" ship destination
    Then I get search results for "leather bag" items
    And next filter tags are visible:
      |tags|
      |Ships to Belarus|
